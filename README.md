# Generative Artificial Intelligence: Generative Image Transformations

This project explores generative artificial intelligence techniques focusing on Temporal Domain Generalization with Drift-Aware Dynamic Neural Networks (DRAIN).
The goal is to understand and visualize how generative models progressively modify or synthesize image content through structured flows.

ðŸ§ª Key Objectives:
- Implement and test GGF-based image transformation pipelines
- Visualize intermediate states and flow-based generation steps
- Provide simple, workshop-level demo code for experimentation and learning

ðŸ“¦ Technologies:
- PyTorch
- Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step experimentation
- DRAIN methods
- VAE methods

This repository serves as a sandbox for AI Labâ€™s rapid prototyping and educational demos.
